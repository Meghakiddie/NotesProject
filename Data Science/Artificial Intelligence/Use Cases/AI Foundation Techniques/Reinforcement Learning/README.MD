# Reinforcement Learning

The Machine Learning does not include the process of taking actions and interacting with an environment as intelligent human beings constantly keep doing the following:

**OBSERVE -> PROCESS -> ACTION**

1. We observe some input from environment, whether it is what we see with our eyes, we hear with our ears, or we remember in our memory.
2. All these inputs are then processed in our brain.
3. Eventually, we make decisions and take actions.

Reinforcement Learning, one of the branches of AI that works to the extent of mimicking human intelligence if we see AI as the science.
