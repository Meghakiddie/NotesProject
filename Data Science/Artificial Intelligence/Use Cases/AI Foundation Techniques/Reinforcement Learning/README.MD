## Convention Used 

We've used real life examples to explain the things in better way by connecting emotions with things, by integrating technology with humanity to solve almost all the problems exist around us. As [Jim Kwik](https://twitter.com/jimkwik?lang=en) says

**LEARNING + EMOTION = LONG TERM MEMORY**

Code Example

```python
print('hello world')

```

# Reinforcement Learning

There's a very great example to understand Reinforcement Learning 

The Machine Learning does not include the process of taking actions and interacting with an environment as intelligent human beings constantly keep doing the following:

**OBSERVE -> PROCESS -> ACTION**

1. We observe some input from environment, whether it is what we see with our eyes, we hear with our ears, or we remember in our memory.
2. All these inputs are then processed in our brain.
3. Eventually, we make decisions and take actions.

Reinforcement Learning, part of the ML, one of the branches of AI that works to the extent of mimicking human intelligence.
