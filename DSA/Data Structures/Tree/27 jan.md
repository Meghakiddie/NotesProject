mostly customer focus on category (category == subtree)
{0, 2} is strict binary tree but programming prospect not always data come for that it may not for this 
tree : non linear bcs it isnot straight 
last node gives u to path of above of its node and above
best way is to create class when space is available for from class
all LL connected to each other > it is linear connection or linear LL also say as linked tree
if u dont know how to travers so print tree not possible (entire tree traverse is imp and critical thing)
4 diff things to traverse in binary tree bcs hard to choose 1by1 here :3 types is one name
                                                                       1 is one name 
3 Type is == Depth first , 1 Type is Breadth first     :DFS=depth first service                                              ,:BFS=breadth first service
                                                        (1)->preorder traverse(clone,help o create same copy)                (4)->level order travers(treetravers)
                                                        (2)->inorder traverse (sorted auotomaticaly if not while travrsing)       
                                                        (3)->post order(usepolishnotation(math)to reverse)
in precreate traverse first got root node -> pick it ->left node use -> it print it -> then goto right tree (general proces)
