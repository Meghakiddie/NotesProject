by default array shift data to left side when 0 position pop 
if our requirement to many serves ex if we call in in call center they pick 1 call which come first 
in array time complexity O(n)
static array hase cvonst while dynamic array somehow also cont(py array)\
if lots of sms comes to servers then it use first in out but if millions of c0ollect it it gets O(n)which is not good in real worls and we not use this apppoach  
in array access or peek time  is const. 
if first position pop out5 then millions of data shift left so queue is worst in real worst 
que is two typw array and linked list
array has two types nofixed capacity and fixed capacity
main topic is circular queue here we used array (fixed capacit5y)
if array == n=10 here we take max 10 items here  we store 10 placesd none for future or accomodate 
-1 == no == means empty  start=-1
+1 is add one value here 
start is var which handle data and last data 
whenever new data comes some dequed opration so we use new data to store
challenge in pop is O(n) in list bcs other shift
inste we store none after acceess data so posiotion not change tieme complexity decrease 
OOM is the out of memory errro when adda data in fixed ram so program crashed  it when program when planed]
in accomadation it not happen
here 1 manager looking for start position and anpoother lookinf for end posio9n 
they looking when 1 in remove [start =0] and last lolokintg for end 
start =0 atsrt =0 start =0 start =0 
end = 1  end = 2 start = 3 
manager keep lkooking for no deque help us to update area id empty
