linked method for tree implement == tree datastructure
queue = datastructure -if dont know so harder to implement breadth first it is criticcal for know cpu, kernal, cs
we only arrenge data in queue when similer requirement comes
first in first out Fifo used for arrenge in data strycture
cpu handle 1 proces at at time bcs cpu shedule it 
process = jobs or arrenge list of jobs are process que-> is like array but use fifo
suppose [a, b, c, ] list her if we add D is known as enque or read it after remove it is called deque which use fifo
Queue = array and liknk list
here array is in two type 1st is -no capacity(no fixed) or -capacity(fixed)
no fixed size is array ex. in python so it is dynamic array where keep append but we dont know if millions of arraengenment comes we use array for this 
in array we give it like queue where happens fifo 
ex d.append("a")
            ("b")        
            ("c")
            ("d")
            ("e") ===[a,b,c,d,e]
peek is to check which address which data ex. d[0]
pop means remove after use it
ex d.pop[0] here a data is out then b get position for 0 --fifo like real queu or line
pop == deque
by this is not  fixed capacity we use classes to create ADT
