we link one node to another for search|reach data
for create next node varaible do 1 one is to accomodatr this to sstore next node hold address or accoodate this is link
 we use steps firstnode then goto left sub tree yhen gotot rightsubtree this same approach we use again n again untill goto last it is process to divide big probem to small  small after ends we use ths same appaoach to right sght
 here so preorder has 3 steps 
 parent consider as root node then move to further we do here goto addres and print it ,
 it is recursion problem so we crete recursion function apply in left ag=fter right 
 here wew use both head and tail recursion but good practice is to use tail recurion and with TCO (tail call recuersion))
 tree is non linear while array and link list list is linearh
