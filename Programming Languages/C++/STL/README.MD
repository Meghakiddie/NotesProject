In every programming languages like C, C++ , Python etc, We have data types or data structures.

What is data structure ?
We have multiple types of data(Data types) like integer, float, boolean, string, To organize these data the approach / alogorithm we use so that in future we can easily retrieve or do some operations, This approach is known as data structure.

We have many types of data structures like array, linked list, Hash Table etc.
To implement these data structures we have 2 ways : - 1. Create own program from scratch, 2. Use precreated data structures 
To use precreated data structures we use STL. So what 

What is STL ?
STL stands for standard template library,  C++ has done and finds all most commonly used data structures, They created 1 library(In which we use precreate data structures) in form of function , properties and class. Library give functions/Class called standard template.

Data structure(DS) also called Container, because it contains STL(precreated libraries) 

Example - Array (Static , Dynamic) 

Static Array : - No need of lib(C++ has capability of creating static array)
Dynamic Array : - Vector

How to import in code :- #include "vector"

Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Singly linked list: - forward_list
Doubly linked list: - list
