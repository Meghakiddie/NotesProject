JS is semi object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming language, and it can be used on both server and client side applications. Any interaction that happens on web page is JavaScript in Action.

JavaScript is an interpreted langauge that means computers and browsers can work with JS on the fly because of the engine that understands JS called Interpreter.

- ```console.log("Hello, World!");```
- ```console.table();```
- ```console.error();```
