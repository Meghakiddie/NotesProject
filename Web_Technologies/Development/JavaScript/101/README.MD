## Variables

Variables are the values in your code that can represent different values each time the code runs. Without the variables, a piece of code would do the exact same thing every single time it was run which makes it static.

### Declaring Variables

In JavaScript, ```let```, ```var```, or ```const``` can be used to declare a variable at first time. Second time, you only use the name of existing variable to assign it a new value. For Example:

```javascript
let studentName = "John";
studentName = "Rock";
```
