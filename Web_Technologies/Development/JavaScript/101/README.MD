## Variables

Variables are the values in your code that can represent different values each time the code runs. Without the variables, a piece of code would do the exact same thing every single time it was run which makes it static.

### Declaring Variables

In JavaScript, ```let```, ```var```, or ```const``` can be used to declare a variable at first time. Second time, you only use the name of existing variable to assign it a new value. For Example:

```javascript
let studentName = "John";
studentName = "Rock";
```

### let, var and const

Generally, the variable definition consists of three parts

- variable-defining keyword (let, var, or const in JavaScript)
- variable name
- variable value

The ```let``` and ```var```, both used for variables that might have new value assigned to them somewhere in the code. The differnce in between both is scope-based

- ```var``` has a global scope; i.e you can use the variables defined with var in the entire script.
- ```let``` has a block scope; i.e you can only use variables defined withlet in the specific block of code in which they were defined.

Note: The block of code will always start with { and end with }

At last, **const** is used for variables that only get a value assigned once.

For example: value of PI, which will not change.

## Primitive Data Types

A relativey simple data structure, just contain a value and have a type.

JavaScript is a loosely typed language. i.e it determines the type based on the value.

For Example: if we declare a value of 10, JavaScript will automatically define it as a number type.

### String

Generally, Strings are used to store a text value, and a sequence of characters.

In JS, following are the different ways to declare a string:

- Double Quotes \"\"
- Single Quotes \'\'
- Backticks: special template strings in which you can use variable directly \`\`

The difference between single quotes and double quotes is that you can use single quotes as [literal characters](/Programming_Languages/README.MD/#terminologies) in dobule quotes strings, and vice-versa.

- If you declare a string with dingle quotes, and string itself contains a single quote character, the string will end as soon as second quote is detected, even if it's in the middle of a word. For Example: 

```javascript
let activity = 'Let's do this';
```

- It can be solved using Double Quotes instead of single quotes, and it will also work vice-versa â€” in case there is a double quote character in your string. For Example: 
 
```javascript
let activity = "Let's do this";
```

In a string, using backticks, you can point to variables and the variable's value will be substituted in the line.

Example Code Snippet

```javascript
let language = "JavaScript";
let message = `Let's learn ${language}`;
console.log(message);
```

Variables in these template strings are specified between ```${nameOfVariable}```.

### Escape Characters

A special character (a backslash "\\") that can be used to tell JavaScript not to take the next character as you normally would.

For Example: ```let string1 = "Hello, What's your name? Is it \"Vikash\"?";```

and will work in this way also

```javascript
let string2 = 'Hello, What\'s your name? Is it "Mike"?';
```

It all happening normally because the backslash before the quote character gives the quote character a different meaning that it should be a literal character instead of an indicator to end string.

Backslash has other more purposes

- It can be used to create a line break with ```\n```

```javascript
let string3 = "New \nline.";
```

- To include a backslash character itself in the text with ```\\```

```javascript
let string4 = "I'm containing a backslash: \\!";
```

### Number

Basically, a datetype used to represent numbers.

Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript has only data type for all the different types of numbers: number.

Developers of JavaScript decided to go for a 64-bit floating-point number; i.e it can store rather large numbers and both signed and unsigned numbers, decimal numbers, and more.

JavaScript can represent the following different kinds of numbers: integers, decimals, exponentials, octal, hexadecimal, and binary numbers.

For Example:

```javascript
int intNr = 1; // Number
int decNr = 1.5; // Decimal;
int expNr = 1.4e15; // Exponential;
int octNr = 0o10; // Octal; decimal version would be 8
int hexNr = 0x3E8; // Hexadecimal; decimal version would be 1000
int binNr = 0b101; // Binary; decimal version would be 5
```

All the above numbers are of the number data type.

Integers, flaoting points, binary numbers all are one data type "number" in the below example

```javascript
let intNr2 = -111; // Unsigned
let decNr2 = 45.78;
let binNr2 = 0b100;
```

### BigInt

In some cases, you will need an even bigger number because of the limits of the number data type which are between 2<sup>53</sup>-1 and -(2<sup>53</sup>-1), BigInt comes into play in this case.

A BigInt data type can be recognized by the postfix n, For Example:

```javascript
let bigNr = 90071992547409920n;
```

It is important to understand that we can't mix BigInt with the Number data type to perform operations.

If we do so, For Example: ```let result = bigNr + intNr;```, it will throw the error as

```console
Uncaught TypeError; Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions
```

### Boolean

The Boolean data type can hold only two values: `true` and `false`; generally used to indicate on/off or yes/no or true/false situations.

For Example:

```javascript
let bool1 = false;
let bool2 = true;
```

More Examples:

Whether an element is deleted

```javascript
let objectIsDeleted = false;
```

Or, whether the light is on or off

```javascript
let lightIsOn = true;
```

### Symbol

Symbol is new data type introduced in ECMA Script 6 or ES6 (current version of JavaScript) which can be used when it is important that variables are not equal, even though their value and type are the same (in this case, they would both be of the symbol type).

For Example: let's compare the following string declarations to the symbol declarations, all of equal value:

```javascript
let str1 = "Hi, JavaScript!";
let str2 = "Hi, JavaScript!";
console.log("Both of two Strings are same: ", str1 === str2);

let sym1 = Symbol("Hi, JavaScript!");
let sym2 = Symbol("Hi, JavaScript!");
console.log("Both of two Symbols are same: ", sym1 === sym2);
```

And the output:

```console
Both of two strings are same: true
Both of two Symbols are same: false
```

What actually happening here is JS concludes that the Strings (`str1` and `str2` in this context) are the same and have the same value, and the same type. However, each Symbol (`sym1` and `sym2`) is unique even they contain the same string, they are not the same, and output `false` when compared; because of the `Symbol` function.

### Undefined

JavaScript has a special data type called "undefined" for a variable that has not been assigned a value.

For Example:

```javascript
let unassigned;
console.log(unassigned);
```

The output here will be

```console
Undefined
```

It is possible to assign an `undefined` value purposefully; but it is even more important to know that manual assignment of `undefined` as a value is not a good practice in Code Writing.

```javascript
let badPracticeToFollow = undefined;
```

There are number of reasons to not do this. For Example

If you're checking for equality, you would want to know whether two values are actually equal, not just that they are both undefined. This way, someone's pet and their last name might be considered equal, whereas they are actually both just empty values.

### null

null is a special value for describing that a variable is empty or has an unknown value. The keyword `null` is case sensitive.

```javascript
let empty = null;
```

The `undefined` issue can be solved with `null`

In previous issue we encountered with setting a variable as undefined, but if you set it to null, you will not have the same problem.

It is one of the great use cases of `null` to assign null to a variable when you want to say it is empty and unknown at first:

```javascript
let badPracticeToFollow = undefined;
let lastName;
console.log("Same undefined: ", lastName === badPracticeToFollow);

let bestPractice = null;
console.log("Same null: ", lastName === betterOption);
```

This outputs the following:

```console
Same undefined: true
Same null: false
```

This shows that an automatically undefined variable (lastName) and a deliberately undefined variable (badPracticeToFollow), are considerd equal, which is problematic. On the other hand, lastName and betterOption, which was explicitly declared with a value of null, are not equal.

## Data Types analysis and modifications

### Working out the type of a variable

To determine what kind of data type you are dealing with especially with null and undefined, the role of `typeof` comes into play.

typeof, an operator in JavaScript, returns the type of the variable, and you can check the type of a variable by entering typeof, then either a space followed by the variable, or the variable in brackets. For Example:

```javascript
testVar = 1;
varTypeTest1 = typeof testVar;
varTypeTest2 = typeof(testVar);

console.log(varTypeTest1);
console.log(varTypeTest2);
```

Both of the methods above will output number. Brackets aren't required because typeof is an operator, not a method, unlike console.log. But, using brackets makes your code easier to read.

More Examples:

```javascript
let str = "Hi";
let nr = 812;
let bigNr = 12345678901234n;
let bool = false;
let sym = Symbol("unique");
let unDef = undefined;
let unknown = null;

console.log("str ", typeof str);
console.log("nr ", typeof nr);
console.log("bigNr ", typeof bigNr);
console.log("bool ", typeof bool);
console.log("sym ", typeof sym);
console.log("unDef ", typeof unDef);
console.log("unknown ", typeof unknown);
```

This will produce the following output:

```console
str String
nr number
bigNr bigint
bool boolean
sym symbol
unDef undefined
unknown object
```

**Important:** Because of backward compatibility problem, null returns object.

### Type Conversion

THe variables in JavaScript can change types.
JavaScript can automatically change the type on the fly unlike other languages. For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 2; // A Number
let nr2 = "2"; // A Sring

console.log(nr1 * nr2);
```

JavaScript does not just throw an error, it first tries to convert the string value to a number.

In this case, console.log will output the 4 in the console.

But, it seems not a good practice to follow; For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 2;
let nr2 = "2";

console.log(nr1 + nr2);
```

This one will log 22. Because, the plus sign here is used to concatenate strings. Therefore, instead of converting a string to a number, it is converting a number to a string, and making them 22.

There are 3 built-in functions we can use to convert the data type of our variable: String(), Number(), and Boolean()

String() converts a variable to type String; takes any value, including undefined and null, and puts quotes around it. For Example:

```javascript
let nrToStr = 6;
nrToStr = String(nrToStr);
console.log(nrToStr, typeof nrToStr);
```

This will log the following:

```console
6 string
```

Number() tries to convert a variable to a number. If that cannot be done logically, it will change the value into NaN (not a number). For Example:

```javascript
let strToNr = "12";
strToNr = Number(strToNr);
console.log(strToNr, typeof strToNr);
```

This will log the following:

```console
12 number
```

Boolean() converts a variable to a Boolean. This will be true for everything except for null, undefined, 0 (number), an empty string, and NaN. For Example:

```javascript
let strToBool = "I'm string, I'll always return true";
strToBool = Boolean(strToBool);
console.log(strToBool, typeof strToBool);
```

This will log the following:

```console
true boolean
```

An empty string and null will both result in the number 0. It can come in handy at times when you want to convert a string to 0 when it is empty or null. For Example:

```javascript
let nullToNr = null;
nullToNr = Number(nullToNr);
console.log("null ", nullToNr, typeof nullToNr);

let strToNr = "";
strToNr = Number(strToNr);
console.log("empty string ", strToNr, typeof strToNr);
```

This will output:

```console
null 0 number
empty string 0 number
```

Anything that can't be interpreted as a number by simply removing the quotes will evaluate as NaN (not a number). For Example:

```javascript
let strToNr2 = "hello";
strToNr2 = Number(strToNr2);
console.log(strToNr2, typeof strToNr2);
```

The result that will be loggd to the console is:

```console
NaN number
```

Any string will return true when converted to a Boolean, even the string "false". Only an empty string, null, and undefined will lead to a Boolean value of false. For Example:

```javascript
let strToBool1 = "false";
strToBool1 = Boolean(strToBool1);
console.log(strToBool1, typeof strToBool1);

let strToBool2 = "";
strToBool2 = Boolean(strToBool2);
console.log(strToBool2, typeof strToBool2);
```

This one will log the following:

```console
true boolean
false boolean
```

## Operators

Operators come in handy whenever we want to work with the variables, modify them, perform calculations on them, and compare them. We use them to operate on our variables.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators can be used to perform operations with numbers.

#### Addition

For this operation in JavaScript, we use "+" operator. For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 12;
let nr2 = 14;
let result1 = nr1 + nr2;
```

For concatenating strings, we can also use this operator. For Example:

```javascript
let str1 = "Hello ";
let str2 = "addition";
let result2 = str1 + str2;
```

The output of printing `result1` and `result2` will be as follows:

```console
26
Hello addition
```

#### Subtraction

We use "-" for subtraction operation. For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 20;
let nr2 = 4;
let str1 = "Hi";
let nr3 = 3;
let result1 = nr1 - nr2;
let result2 = str1 - - nr3;
console.log(result1, result2);
```

The first result will be `16`. And the second one will be `NaN`, not because of any error, but just simply the conclusion that a word and a number subtracted is not a number. That's how JavaScript handle minor things beautifully.

The output is as follows:

```console
16 NaN
```

#### Multiplication

We can multiply two numeric values with the * character (an operator). For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 15;
let nr2 = 10;

let result1 = nr1 * nr2;

console.log(result1);
```

This will simply output:

```console
150
```

Unlike some other languages, we cannot successfully multiply a number and a string in JavaScript. For Example:

```javascript
let str1 = "Hi";
let nr3 = 3;

let result2 = str1 * nr3;

console.log(result2);
```

Output:

```console
NaN
```

#### Division

Like other operators, division straightforwardly works by dividing two number with the / character. For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 30;
let nr2 = 5;

let result1 = nr1 / nr2;
console.log(result1);
```

This will simply output:

```console
6
```

#### Exponentiation

For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 2;
let nr2 = 3;
let result1 = nr1 ** nr2;
console.log(result1);
```

We get the following output:

```console
8
```

#### Modulus

Modulus (% operator in JavaScript) is the operation in which you determine how much is left after dividing a number by another number in its entirety.

The outcome will be the remainder, or what is left over. For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 10;
let nr2 = 3;

let result1 = nr1 % nr2;
console.log(`${nr1} % ${nr2} = ${result1}`);
```

And the output:

```console
10 % 3 = 1
```

#### Unary Operators: Increment and Decrement

**Terminology:** Operands are subject to the operator. So, if we say x + y, x and y are operands.

We only need one operand for these operators, we often call them unary operators. If we see x++, we can read this as x = x + 1; for x-- it is x = x -1.

For Example:

```javascript
let nr1 = 4;
nr1++;
console.log(nr1);

let nr2 = 4;
nr2--;
console.log(nr2);
```

The output is as follows:

```console
5
3
```

##### Prefix and Postfix Operators

We can have the increment / decrement operator after / before operand, we call them postfix unary operator (x++) and prefix unary operator (++x) respectively.

The postfix gets executed after sending the variable through, and then after that, the operation gets executed.

For Example:

```javascript
let nr = 2;
console.log(nr++);
console.log(nr);
```

The output is as follows:

```console
2
3
```

The prefix gets executed before sending the variable through. For Example:

```javascript
let nr = 2;
console.log(++nr);
```

The output:

```console
3
```

#### Combining the operators

These operators can be combined, and it works just as it does in math. They get executed in a certain order, and not necessarily from left to right due to operator precedence.

One more thing to take into accoutn here, and that is grouping, and it can be done using ( and ).

- The operations between the parentheses have the highest precedence.

After that, the order of the operations takes place based on the type of operation (highest precedence first) and if they are of equal precedence, they take place from left to right.

Name | Symbol | Example
--- | --- | ---
Grouping | (...) | (x + y)
Exponentiation | ** | x ** y
Prefix increment and decrement | --, ++ | --x, ++y
Multiplication, division, modulus | *,/,% | x * y, x / y, x % y
Addition and subtraction | +, - | x + y, x - y

### Assignment Operators

"=" character is used for basic assignment.

Every binary arithmetic operator has a corresponding assignment operator to write a shorter piece of code. For Example:

```javascript
let x = 2;
x += 2; // x = x + 2; It will be 4

x -= 2; // x = x - 2; It will be 2

x *= 6; // x = x * 6; It will be 12

x /= 3; // x = x / 3; It will be 4

x **= 2; // x = x**2; It will be 16

x %= 3; // x = x % 3; It will be 1
```

### Comparison Operators

Outcome of the comparison operators is always a Boolean: true or false.

#### Equal

Equality operators determine whether two values are equal. They come in two flavors: equal value only (==), or equal value and data type (===).

The first one returns two when the values are equal, even though the type is different, while the second returns true only when the value and the type are the same: For Example:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = "5";

console.log(x == y); // it will only check for equal value and not for data type.

console.log(x === y); // it will evaluate both the value and the data type to determine whether bot sides are equal or not.
```

#### Not Equal

Not Equal (!=) Operator, similar to equal, except it does the opposite. It returns true when two variables are not equal, and false when they are equal.

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = "5";

console.log(x != y) // This will log false to the console

console.log(x !== y) // This will conclude that since x and y have different data types, they are not the same, and will log true to the console.
```

#### Greater than and Smaller than

Greater than & Smaller than operator returns true if the left-hand side is greater than the right one, and the left-hand side is smaller than the right one respectively.

We also have a greater than or equal to (>=) & smaller than or equal to (<=), which returns true if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right one, and if the left-hand side is smaller than or equal to the right one respectively.

For Example:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 6;

console.log(y > x); // Will log true, because y is greater than x

console.log(x > y); // Will log false, because x is not greater than y

console.log(y > y);

console.log(y >= y);

console.log(y < x); // Will lof false, because y is not smaller than x

console.log(x < y); // Will log true, because x is smaller than y

console.log(y < y); // Log False

console.log(y <= y); // Log True
```

### Logical Operators

Used when you want to check two conditions in one.

#### And

For Example:

```javascript
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
let z = 3;

console.log(x < y && y < z); // Will log true

console.log(x > y && y < z); // Will log false
```

#### Or

#### Not
