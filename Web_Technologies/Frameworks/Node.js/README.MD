# Node.js

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript platform that allows developers to build fast and sclable applications using JavaScript outside of web browsers.

Node.js runs on top of the ultra-fast JavaScript engine at the heart of Google's Chrome browser, V8.

The major focus of Node.js is high-performance, highly scalable web apps, and in other areas.
