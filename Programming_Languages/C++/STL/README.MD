In every programming languages like C, C++ , Python etc, We have data types or data structures. <br>

What is data structure ?  <br>
We have multiple types of data(Data types) like integer, float, boolean, string, To organize these data the approach / alogorithm we use  so that in future we can easily retrieve or do some operations, This approach is known as data structure. <br>

We have many types of data structures like array, linked list, Hash Table etc.<br>
To implement these data structures we have 2 ways : - 1. Create own program from scratch, 2. Use precreated data structures 
To use precreated data structures we use STL. <br>

What is STL ?  <br>
STL stands for standard template library,  C++ has done and finds all most commonly used data structures, They created 1 library(In which we use precreate data structures) in form of function , properties and class. Library give functions/Class called standard template. <br>

Data structure(DS) also called Container, because it contains STL(precreated libraries)  <br>

Example - Array (Static , Dynamic) <br>

Static Array : - No need of lib(C++ has capability of creating static array)  <br>
Dynamic Array : - Vector       <br>

How to import in code :- #include "vector" <br>

Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  <br>

Singly linked list: - forward_list  <br>
Doubly linked list: - list          <br>
